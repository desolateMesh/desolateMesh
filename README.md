In my journey through the professional world, I've always been anchored by a robust set of strengths and values. I pride myself on my strong written and verbal 
communication skills and have developed a knack for time management. While I continually strive to improve my programming skills, diving into new languages and exploring advanced topics remains a consistent passion. My ethical compass steers me towards valuing the protection of both organizations and individuals, and I prioritize ensuring equitable access to all authorized personnel.

What fascinates me most about the realm of cybersecurity is the art of defense. Contrary to my natural inclinations in other areas, cybersecurity challenges me to decipher the thought processes and intentions of adversaries through their digital footprints. I believe in lifelong learning, and whether it's through my professional engagements, academic pursuits, or personal endeavors in my home lab, I am committed to expanding my knowledge. As I look forward to pursuing my Master's in Information Technology in 2024, I am confident that my strengths, values, and inherent interest in cybersecurity will significantly contribute to and support the security objectives of any organization I partner with.

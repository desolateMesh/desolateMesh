*In my journey through the professional world, I've always been anchored by a robust set of strengths and values. I pride myself on my strong written and verbal communication skills and have developed a knack for time management. While I continually strive to improve my programming skills, diving into new languages and exploring advanced topics remains a consistent passion. My ethical compass steers me towards valuing the protection of both organizations and individuals, and I prioritize ensuring equitable access.*
